# Title
Convert all Node-Express APIs to Typescript

## Status

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-accepted-green) 

## Context

* Each API should share the same technical requirements outside of the domain model.
* Typescript is being used for the UI application.
* Typescript makes you think more about the code constructs
* The time factor is the real constraint here.

## Decision

* Switch to Typescript before or after 1) first release or 2) funding

## Impact/Risks/Consequences

* The impact here is to coding time and resources
* I don't really see any current risks to 1) first release or 2) funding initiative
* Making this change now would provide consistency in development and less confusion among teammates.
