# Architectural Decision Records

## What are architecture decision records?

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that documents an architecture 
decision (AD) a made because of an architecturally-significant non-functional or 
functional requirement. These decisions are ones that have a large influence on 
architecture, are fundamental to the way the software is built, or would be difficult 
to reverse.

All architecture decision records make up this architecture decision log.

## How to use this log?

* Use the table to below to see a history of the logs

### How to make a new decision record?

1. Copy the [template](./adr/template.md) to a new file in the `adr` directory with format `my_title.md`.
2. Fill out the information
3. Add the record to the table. The Decision columns should link to the ADR.
